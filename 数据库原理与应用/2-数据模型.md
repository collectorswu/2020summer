# Data Model数据模型

## Hierarchical Data Model(层次模型)

- Tree

- PCR
  - A data scheme consists of PCRs
  - Every PCR expresses one 1:N relationship
  - Every record type can only have one parent
- Virtual Record

## Network Data Model(网状模型)

- Set

- Record 
- Data Items
- Link record

## Relational Data Model(关系模型)

###  Feature

- Table
- Based on set theory, high abstract level.
- Relational Algebra
- No procedure query language ----SQL
- Soft Link

### Term

- Attribution(属性) and Domain(域)
  - Atomic data --- 1NF
  - Null
- Relation(关系) and Tuple(元组)
  - An entity of real world can be expressed as one or more than one relations.
  - A relation is a N-ary relationship defined on all of its attribute domain.
  - This is called the schema of R, and n is the number of attributes, called the degree of R. Ai(1≤i ≤n) is attribute name.
  - An instance (value) of R can be expressed as r or r(R), it is a set of n-tuple.
  - Relation is also called table. Attribute is also called column, and tuple is also called row.
- Primary Key
  - 极大无关组
- Foreign Key
  - 引用其他表，在被引用表中是主键，这组属性在这张表中是外键
  - Enrolled，不能指空
- Other Integrity Constraints
  - Domain integrity constraint: An attributes' value must be a value in the domain of this attribute.
  - Entity integrity constraint: The value of primary key of each tuple must be unique. Primary key cannot be NULL.
